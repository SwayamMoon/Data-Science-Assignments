# 📊 Assignment 04: Hypothesis Testing (Parametric & Non-Parametric)

## 🎯 Project Goal (Maksad)
The objective was to perform two distinct, real-world hypothesis tests to draw data-driven conclusions, demonstrating proficiency in both **parametric (Z-Test)** and **non-parametric (Chi-Square) testing**.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy (`stats` module)

## 💡 Key Insights & Technical Learnings

### 1. Z-Test for Operational Costs (Bombay Hospitality Ltd. Case)
> **Hypothesis Tested:** Investigated the claim that the weekly operating costs of restaurants are higher than the theoretical model suggests.
> **Result:** The calculated **Test Statistic** was [Final value of Test Statistic - *yahaan value likhiye*]. By comparing this to the **Critical Value** at a 5% significance level, we were able to **[Reject/Fail to Reject]** the Null Hypothesis.
> **Conclusion:** The analysis provides **[Strong/Weak]** evidence to support the restaurant owners' claim of higher operating costs.

### 2. Chi-Square Test for Independence (Mizzare Corporation Case)
> **Hypothesis Tested:** Determined if there is a **significant association** between the **type of device purchased** (Smart Thermostats vs. Smart Lights) and the **customer satisfaction level**.
> **Result:** The **Chi-Square Statistic** was found to be [Final Chi-Square value - *yahaan value likhiye*], which was **[Greater/Less]** than the Critical Value.
> **Conclusion:** We **[Rejected/Failed to Reject]** the Null Hypothesis, confirming that there **[is/is no]** statistically significant association between the device type and customer satisfaction.

### 3. Core Statistical Learning
> This assignment reinforces the crucial skill of choosing the **correct statistical test** (Z-Test for means, Chi-Square for categorical association) and interpreting the results using **p-value or critical value** for making evidence-based business decisions.
