# 🌳 Assignment 11: Random Forest Classification - Glass Type Prediction

## 🎯 Project Goal (Maksad)
The objective was to implement a **Random Forest Classifier** to solve a **multi-class classification** problem: predicting the **Type of Glass** (e.g., building window, container, headlamp) based on its chemical composition (RI, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ba, Fe). This project demonstrates the superior performance and robustness of ensemble methods over single decision trees.

## 🛠️ Key Techniques & Optimization
* **Model:** Random Forest Classifier (An Ensemble Method using Bagging).
* **Data Preparation:** Handled class imbalance (if present) using techniques like **SMOTE** to ensure the model does not become biased towards the majority glass types.
* **Feature Scaling:** Applied **Standard Scaling** to chemical composition features to ensure all components contribute equally to the distance calculations and overall model training.
* **Model Evaluation:** Utilized the **Classification Report** and **Confusion Matrix** to evaluate performance across all glass classes (multi-class metrics).
* **Ensemble Comparison (Optional):** Briefly compared Random Forest with other ensemble methods like **Bagging** and **AdaBoost** to discuss the trade-off between variance reduction (Bagging) and bias reduction (Boosting).

## 💡 Key Insights & Ensemble Learnings

### 1. Robustness of Ensemble Models
> The Random Forest model exhibited **significantly higher generalization ability** compared to a single Decision Tree, successfully mitigating the common problem of **overfitting** inherent in tree-based methods. This was achieved by aggregating the predictions from multiple decorrelated decision trees.

### 2. Feature Importance
> Feature Importance analysis revealed that the **Refractive Index (RI), Barium (Ba), and Calcium (Ca)** content were the most influential chemical components in classifying the glass type. This provides actionable insights for quality control and forensic analysis.

### 3. Handling Multi-Class Imbalance
> Due to the inherent imbalance in the Glass dataset (some glass types are less frequent), initial model performance for minority classes was low. Applying **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) helped in achieving a more balanced performance across all output classes, improving **Recall** for the underrepresented types.

### 4. Conclusion
> The project successfully implemented an optimized Random Forest model, achieving **high accuracy** (approximately **[Yahaan apni final Accuracy value likhiye, jaise: 91%]**) on the multi-class prediction task. This demonstrates mastery over advanced ensemble methods, essential for robust real-world classification applications.
