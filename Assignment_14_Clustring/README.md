## 🔍 Data Preprocessing & Exploration
Before clustering, the data undergoes several refinement steps:
- 🧹 Handling missing values & eliminating outliers for cleaner insights  
- 🔄 Feature scaling to ensure fair treatment of data attributes  
- 📈 Detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with vivid visualizations to tease out initial patterns and shape hypotheses

## 🛠️ Clustering Methodology
- **K-Means Clustering:** Uncover naturally forming groups by experimenting with cluster counts (using the Elbow method to find the perfect fit!)  
- **DBSCAN:** Detect clusters of varying shapes and densities by fine-tuning epsilon and minimum points parameters  
- Using Python and powerful libraries like **scikit-learn** for smooth and efficient implementation
