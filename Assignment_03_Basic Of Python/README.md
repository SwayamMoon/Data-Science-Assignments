# 💻 Assignment 03: Core Python Programming Fundamentals

## 🎯 Project Goal (Maksad)
The objective of this assignment was to demonstrate proficiency in fundamental Python programming constructs, logical flow control, and basic data structures. This project covers essential coding challenges that form the basis for complex data manipulation.

## 🛠️ Concepts Demonstrated (Kaunse Skills Use Kiye)
* **Flow Control:** `if/else`, `for` loops, and `while` loops for logical decision-making.
* **Data Structures:** Dictionaries (for **Word Counting**) and Lists.
* **Functions:** Creating reusable functions (e.g., `is_palindrome`) for clean and modular code.
* **User Input & Randomization:** Handling user interaction (`input()`) and generating random numbers (`random` module).

## 💡 Key Exercises Completed

### 1. Palindrome Checker & Word Counter
> Developed a robust **Palindrome Checker** that handles strings by ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization. Also implemented a **Word Counter** using dictionaries to efficiently track the frequency of words in a given text, a crucial skill for text data processing.

### 2. Number Theory & Iteration
> Successfully implemented the logic for checking **Prime Numbers** (demonstrating division logic) and created loops to generate the squares of **Even/Odd Numbers** within a specific range.

### 3. Conclusion
> This project solidifies the foundational **Python syntax and logic** necessary to effectively transition into using powerful data libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data science projects. The focus on modular functions and clean logic ensures the code is scalable and maintainable.
